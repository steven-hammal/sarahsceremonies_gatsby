            <a href="https://humanism.org.uk/">Humanist</a> weddings are, in a nutshell, completely unique. 
            Each ceremony is made specifically for the couple and explores what 
            they want from their celebration so that the couple and their guests 
            have the best day imaginable. 
            Humanism is a stand point that does not believe in God. 
            The focus in both Humanism and in a Humanist wedding 
            is that we should try to be the best people that 
            we can be in the here and now. 
            Humanist weddings are not yet legally binding in England,
            but hopefully will be soon. 
            We can build in the legal element of the marriage 
            through joint ventures or the this can be carried out on another day, 
            enabling the focus to remain on the celebration of the union.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every <a href="https://humanism.org.uk/ceremonies/non-religious-weddings/">humanist wedding</a> is unique but often couples ask what 
            the process is and what to expect. It is essential that we 
            meet a few times so that the wedding that I write for you reflects 
            you properly. 
            It is usual to have an initial meeting, 
            a detailed planning meeting and a rehearsal. 
            As well as the ceremony itself, 
            you will recieve a presentation copy of your wedding script and 
            certificate. Since each Humanist wedding is tailored to the couple, 
            the process is very flexible. 
            I generally charge Â£400 for these services as a guide.

            I have lived in Sunderland all my life, apart from brief forays into 
            the 'Toon'. I have a fantastic, supportive family and two little boys 
            who are a source of constant education about the meaning of love and 
            happiness (and stickiness). 
            I am happy to travel to locations that fit with your dream wedding as 
            far as the Lake District and North Yorkshire. 
            My passions include attempting to bake, reading graphic novels, and  
            I'm currently obsessed with Gardeners World as I renovate the gardens 
            at our new home. 
            I'd love to hear about your inspirations as a couple and learn how we 
            can use them to build a unique wedding ceremony for you.
          </p>
          <p>  
            I started my career as a teacher of Religious Education and taught 
            about Humanism alongside other faiths. Teaching instilled in me that 
            planning is everything, the importance of time keeping to the second 
            and how to write a script that can captivate and hold an audience! 
            I love to write and perform unique ceremonies and can't wait to do 
            my first ceremony in cosplay.

            Some couples like to include within their ceremony 
            a gesture that symbolises their relationship. 
            For example, traditional handfasting ceremonies celebrate two 
            individuals becoming one and can be tailored to reflect the couples 
            by asking different groups of family members to come and perform 
            the binding. Sand blending can enable extended families with children 
            to include everyone and blend them together as one big new family. 
            Outdoor ceremonies lend themselves to the blanket ceremony or 
            flower ceremonies. Please ask how you could incoprate a symbolic 
            gesture into your big day.
          </p>
          <p>
            A wedding is not only about two people but also about 
            the joining of two or more families. 
            Invite them to participate and share the joy of the day. 
            Children can be a wealth of entertainment, particularly if 
            the thought of your big day is stressful, so call forth our 
            youth and utilise their charm. Additionally, there is no greater 
            honour than to be asked to read or perform at a 
            loved one's ceremony. With a humanist wedding you can give that 
            honour to those you love to the extent that you wish.
          </p>
          <p>
            Humanism is all about making ethical choices, 
            so why not build that into your wedding and shout proudly that 
            you wish the best for mankind and our planet? Do this through your 
            venue choice, your wedding favours, 
            donations to charities and the inclusion of ethical readings.

              "Sarah was fantastic. From day one she was very warm and totally understood 
              the type of service I wanted. It was surprise for my husband and whole family 
              and Sarah went to extra lengths to make sure it stayed that way. 
              Everyone commented about the lovely service Sarah conducted and both myself 
              and my partner thoroughly enjoyed our special day. 
              Thank you for helping to make such wonderful memories that myself, my partner 
              and children will cherish forever."
